                avenues for education, with online courses and e-learning platforms.<br><br>Another positive impact of technology is in the medical field. Advances in medical technology have led to better diagnosis and treatment of diseases, resulting in improved health outcomes. For instance, the use of 3D printing in creating prosthetic limbs has significantly improved the lives of amputees. Furthermore, telemedicine has made healthcare more accessible to those living in remote areas,

                equipment create a significant amount of electronic waste (e-waste). This has harmful effects on the environment as e-waste contains hazardous chemicals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can pollute soil and water sources. Moreover, electronic waste generates greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change.<br><br>Another negative impact of technology is the decrease in physical activity due to sedentary lifestyles.

                People are spending more time sitting in front of screens, leading to a rise in obesity, diabetes, and other health problems. Furthermore, excessive use of technology can lead to addiction and mental health issues, including anxiety and depression.<br><br>In conclusion, technology has brought about many positive changes in our lives, but it also has its negative impacts on the environment and our

                health. It is important for us to be mindful of these negative effects and take steps to minimize them. We can start by recycling our electronic waste, reducing our screen time, and being more physically active. We can also advocate for more responsible use of technology, such as sustainable production and disposal of electronic devices, and
